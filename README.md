stat545a-2013-hw06
==================

The [volcanoe data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AonYZs4MzlZbdHU2anpicEt4cW54RGUtVzN2djcyc2c#gid=0) used in this exercise was spotted by Neil Spencer in the STATS 545 (yr 2013) forum. It was downloaded and saved as "vo.txt". I simply cleaned the data a bit, and made a map out of it. 

Note on intention:
I understand that the course does not emphasize on map making, but i am really interested in exploring this aspect using ggplot. It might be relevant to some students as well.

Instructions:
Download  [vo.txt](https://github.com/xxue/stat545a-2013-hw06/blob/master/vo.txt), [01_cleanvoc.r](https://github.com/xxue/stat545a-2013-hw06/blob/master/01_cleanvoc.r), [02_plotvoc.r](https://github.com/xxue/stat545a-2013-hw06/blob/master/02_plotvoc.r), [03_vocmakefile](https://github.com/xxue/stat545a-2013-hw06/blob/master/03_vocmakefile.r)
Run the "03_vocmakefile"

Outputs are deposited above as well, just in case.
